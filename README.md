# ScrapeAmazon
This project focuses on scraping Amazon product listings, specifically in the skincare category. It extracts key product details, including the product name, brand, price, discounted price, rating, and number of ratings. To enhance efficiency, multithreading was implemented, allowing multiple pages to be scraped simultaneously.

After collecting the data, it undergoes cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency. The refined dataset is then prepared for visualization and analysis in Tableau, providing insights into pricing trends, brand popularity, and customer reviews.
